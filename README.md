Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through learning from data, without being explicitly programmed. In other words, machine learning allows computers to learn from experience and make predictions or decisions based on that learning.
